# Python Examples 🐍
I collect the exercises, algorithms, and sample projects I've done while learning the Python programming language in this repository.

📂 Contents
Current projects:

*NumberGuessingGame: A simple console game where the user tries to guess a random number between the lower and upper limits they set.

(I will add to this list as I create new examples.)

⚙️ How to Run It?
These projects can be run directly using the Python 3.x interpreter installed on your system. You can use any external IDE (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.) or your terminal.
